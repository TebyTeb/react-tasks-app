# React Todo list app

Hi, and most welcome! This is my first
implementation of a simple Todo list app 
in React.

In order to build this app I followed the 
React documentation, alongside Udemi 
courses.
#
## Technologies:

This app is built using the following:
- ViteJS
- ReactJS (obviously)
- NodeJS
- Tailwind with PostCss
